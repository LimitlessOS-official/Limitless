# LimitlessOS Demo Script

This directory contains a shell script (`demo.sh`) that visually demonstrates the LimitlessOS bootsplash, installer, and desktop UI as text-based mockups. Run the script to get a quick visual overview of the user experience and feature layout.

## Usage

```sh
temp-test/demo.sh
```

## What You See
- **Bootsplash:** Logo, edition, tagline
- **Installer:** Edition selection, optional features, navigation
- **Desktop:** Menu, apps, wallpaper, taskbar, desktop icons

This is a demo for visual planning and feedback. For a full graphical experience, integrate with the actual UI toolkit and assets.

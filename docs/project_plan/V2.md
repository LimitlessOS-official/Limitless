# LimitlessOS V2.0 — Security-First, Production-Grade Transformation

**Program Owner:** LimitlessOS-official  
**Scope:** Transform LimitlessOS into a production-grade, hybrid kernel OS superior in Security, Performance, and Stability to Windows 11 24H2, macOS Sequoia, and Ubuntu 24.10.

## 0. Principles and Guardrails

- **Security-first:** Minimal privileged code, W^X everywhere, strict MAC and sandboxing, signed modules, measured boot.
- **Hybrid kernel:** Protected modular services with message passing, capability-based handles.
- **Completeness rule:** No stubs, placeholders, TODOs, or partial implementations in mainline.
- **Reproducible builds:** Hermetic toolchains, SBOM, signed artifacts, bit-for-bit ISO reproducibility.
- **Hardware adaptive:** x86-64 primary, x86 compatibility path; feature gating (SMEP/SMAP/UMIP/CET/PCID/x2APIC).
- **Evidence-based:** Every milestone has measurable acceptance and verification gates.

## 6. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Dependencies

### Critical Path
```
M0 (Sanitation) → M1 (Boot) → M2 (VMM) → M3 (MAC) → M4 (IPC/Sched)
                                      ↓
                                   M5 (LFS)
```

### Parallel Development Tracks
- **After M2/M3:** M7 (Drivers) and M8 (Networking) can parallelize
- **Graphics (M9):** Can start after M2 is stable
- **Testing (M10):** Ongoing throughout all milestones

### High-Risk Areas
- **Filesystem (M5):** Complex crash consistency, allocate extra fuzzing time
- **Networking (M8):** Protocol complexity, extensive conformance testing required

### Dependencies
- M0 → M1/M2: Clean foundation required for CPU and memory work
- M3 depends on M2: MAC needs VMM primitives
- M4 depends on M3: Capabilities required for secure IPC
- M5 depends on M3: ACLs and policy integration
- M6 depends on M3/M4: Syscalls use capabilities and need MAC checks
- M7 depends on M2/M3: Drivers need VMM and MAC integration
- M8 depends on M2/M3/M4: Networking needs all core primitives
- M9 depends on M2/M3/M7: Graphics needs VMM, MAC, and PCI
- M10 depends on all: Testing validates everything

## Security Principles

LimitlessOS V2.0 follows these core security principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary permissions for all operations
3. **Fail Secure**: Secure failure modes and error handling
4. **Complete Mediation**: All accesses checked for authorization
5. **Open Design**: Security through design, not obscurity
6. **Separation of Privilege**: Multiple conditions required for access
7. **Least Common Mechanism**: Minimize shared security mechanisms
8. **Psychological Acceptability**: Security mechanisms must be usable

## Security Features

### Runtime Security
- **W^X Enforcement**: Writable XOR executable memory everywhere
- **SMEP/SMAP**: Supervisor Mode Execution/Access Prevention
- **CET**: Control-flow Enforcement Technology (shadow stacks)
- **KASLR**: Fine-grained kernel address space layout randomization
- **Stack Protection**: Strong stack canaries and guards
- **RO-after-init**: Critical data structures immutable after initialization

### Boot Security
- **UEFI Secure Boot**: Verified bootloader chain
- **TPM2 Measured Boot**: Boot measurements in TPM
- **Module Signing**: Mandatory signature verification for all kernel modules

### Access Control
- **MAC Framework**: Label-based mandatory access control
- **Capabilities**: Fine-grained capability-based security
- **Sandboxing**: Default-deny application sandboxing
- **IOMMU**: Hardware-enforced DMA isolation

## Threat Model Summary

LimitlessOS addresses the following threat categories:

- **Spoofing**: Identity verification and authentication
- **Tampering**: Integrity protection and verification
- **Repudiation**: Audit logging and non-repudiation
- **Information Disclosure**: Confidentiality and access control
- **Denial of Service**: Resource limits and availability
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Privilege separation and least privilege

See [threat-model.md](threat-model.md) for detailed analysis.

## Security Testing

Security verification includes:

- **Static Analysis**: Code scanning for vulnerabilities
- **Fuzzing**: Systematic input fuzzing of all interfaces
- **Penetration Testing**: Security assessment by skilled testers
- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proof of critical properties
- **Security Audits**: Regular third-party security audits

## Reporting Security Issues

Security vulnerabilities should be reported to: security@limitlessos.org

See [vulnerability-disclosure.md](vulnerability-disclosure.md) for the full disclosure policy.

## Compliance and Certifications

LimitlessOS aims to achieve:

- Common Criteria EAL4+
- FIPS 140-3 Level 2 (cryptographic modules)
- DO-178C Level A (for safety-critical deployments)
- IEC 62443 (industrial security)

## Contributing to Security
